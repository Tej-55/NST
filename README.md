Neural Style Transfer
This is a one of my favorite projects involving a GANs.
It involves you giving the input image which you want to
be recreated in the 'style' of any other image.
Here, I used a winter-snowy picture to be reconstructed
in the style of my favorite painting, i.e., The Starry Sky by Van Gogh
